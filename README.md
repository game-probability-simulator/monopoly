Game Probability Simulator for Monopoly.

The goal of this project is to create a Game Probability SImulator for Monopoly.

There are three main files involved in this project:

 1. `chance.py`: Give probabilities to move forward or backwards on Chance or Community Chest squares.
 2. `probability.py`: Give probabilities to land on each square.
 3. `monopoly.py`: Figure out which spots are most worth buying.

This project is still in active development. Do not expect this to completely work.
